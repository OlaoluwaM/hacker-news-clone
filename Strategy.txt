Major Problem: Displaying the comment for each Post when the number of comments is clicked
    Minor: 1. I need the ID of the post passed into the comments componenet ✔️
           2. I need a way to cause a re-render to display the comments since I am not using react router yet ✔️
           3. From the ID passed into <Comment />, I fetch the post and its kids (comments) in the componenet
           4. I need to set the state on the comments components to store the id and array of comments
